  "Contract clause logic, evaluated under an explicitly configured vocabulary.

  Accord's own clause logic is TypeScript, and the archive's `package.json`
  declares `\"runtime\": \"typescript\"` -- a field that has already held another
  value, `\"ergo\"`, in published templates. So the logic runtime is pluggable by
  design, and this is a third one.

  The point is not the language. Ergo was trustworthy because it was
  *restricted*: it could not reach the network, import arbitrary code, or read a
  clock. General-purpose Clojure has strictly more ambient authority than
  sandboxed TypeScript, so it would be a step backwards on its own. What makes
  this defensible is that the host decides what exists -- the vocabulary below
  is the entire surface a clause can reach.

  Two absences are deliberate and load-bearing:

  no clock    Accord's own acceptance-of-delivery clause calls `new Date()`, so
              re-running the same request tomorrow gives a different answer. It
              cannot be replayed, which means the stored response is the only
              record of what was decided. Here time arrives as an argument, so a
              clause is a pure function of its inputs and can be re-evaluated.

  no `/`      `(/ 1 3)` is an exact ratio on the JVM and a float in
              ClojureScript. Contract logic computing interest or proration
              would silently diverge between a server and a browser running
              identical source. `divide` takes an explicit scale instead."
